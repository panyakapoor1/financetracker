## 🚀 Automation & CI/CD

This project uses **GitHub Actions** for 100% automated deployment:
- **Frontend**: Automatically built and deployed to **GitHub Pages**.
- **Backend**: Automatically triggered to redeploy on **Render** via webhooks.
- **Security**: Automated vulnerability scanning on every push.

## Features

### Core
- **Dashboard** — At-a-glance summary of income, expenses, balance, budget alerts, and recent transactions.
- **Transactions** — Create, view, search, filter, and delete income/expense records. Supports filtering by type, category, and free-text search.
- **Budgets** — Set monthly spending limits per category with visual progress bars that turn yellow at 80% and red when exceeded.
- **Reports & Analytics** — Interactive charts (line, doughnut) powered by Chart.js showing income vs expense trends, spending by category, savings rate, and a detailed category breakdown table.
- **CSV Export** — Download all your transaction data as a CSV file, with optional date range filtering.

### Advanced
- **Recurring Transactions** — Automate tracking of regular bills and income (rent, subscriptions, salary). Set frequency (daily/weekly/monthly/yearly), pause/resume at any time.
- **Savings Goals** — Set financial targets (emergency fund, vacation, new car) with custom icons, colors, deadlines, and a deposit/withdraw system to track progress.
- **Achievements** — Gamified experience with unlockable badges (e.g., "100 Club", "Budget Master") based on your financial milestones and habits.
- **Transaction Search & Filters** — Instantly search transactions by category name, description, or amount. Filter by type (income/expense) and category.

### Security
- JWT-based authentication with refresh tokens
- Password hashing with bcrypt
- Input validation with Joi
- Rate limiting, Helmet security headers, CORS protection
- NoSQL injection prevention with express-mongo-sanitize

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v16+
- A MongoDB Atlas cluster (free tier works fine)
- npm or yarn

### 1. Clone & install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/panyakapoor1/financetracker.git
cd financetracker

# Backend
cd backend
npm install
cp .env.example .env   # then edit with your MongoDB URI and JWT secrets

# Frontend
cd ../frontend
npm install
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

**Backend** (`backend/.env`):
```
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=5000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@cluster.mongodb.net/finance-tracker

JWT_REFRESH_SECRET=your_jwt_refresh_secret
JWT_EXPIRE=15m
JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=7d
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

**Frontend** (`frontend/.env`):
```
REACT_APP_API_URL=http://localhost:5000/api
```

### 3. Run

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Backend
cd backend
npm run dev        # starts on http://localhost:5000

# Terminal 2 — Frontend
cd frontend
npm start          # starts on http://localhost:3000

## Deployment

This project is configured for **Automated CI/CD** via GitHub Actions.

### Automated Deployment (Recommended)
Every push to the `main` branch automatically:
1. Builds the frontend and deploys it to **GitHub Pages**.
2. Triggers a redeploy of the backend (if `RENDER_DEPLOY_HOOK` secret is set).

See the [Deployment Guide](DEPLOYMENT.md) for setup instructions.
